# Rocket Malfunction

Until 7/29/2015, the Rocket M2 that was attached to the vehicle and was able to supply an Internet connection to the Pi.
However, it was tampered with on that date and it no longer functions as it should; it has been switched from a router to an access point 
and no longer routes Internet connection to the Pi. In retrospect, we should have researched the effects of changing the mode of
the Rocket M2 and weighed the pros and cons of the switch. As far as we know at the moment, a full reset of the Rocket is the fastest
way to return it to the router mode, but other methods of rectifying the problem will be explored.
