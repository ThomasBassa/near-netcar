# Sprint Two Reflections / Postmortem

## Keep
- Representative meetings

## Problems
- Communication (between everyone)
- Google Hangouts use (bulk video calls, interruptions)
- Lack of focus

## Try
- Spend more time coming up with short-term tasks
- 1-to-1 Skype calls between companies (instead of groups)
