<The goal of design is so that we're not floundering around when
it comes time to build. And we work through the logic of 
everything before we do it.>


1. 
<We need a description of the system. The purpose. What it should do
, just a summary type thing that should be about a paragraph.>

2. 
<Then we make a chart showing the different subsystems on our vehicle
and how they work together. Use box diagram. This should include 
obstacle avoidance, motor control, servo control, the raspberry Pi,
the light, struts, the sound, batteries, crossbar.io and its 
communication, anything you think is separate from other things 
but important>

3. 
<Then for each thing in your diagram, write about its design>

<What is design? A blueprint for how you'll put things together.
This means what's connected in hardware. What pins go to what.
What libraries or type of communication (I2C or Serial or Wifi).
How it'll attach to the vehicle. Write a few use cases about what 
it'll actually do in the system (if applicable). What parts will 
be used?Write pseudo code (if applicable) and name the algorithms that
will be used (if applicable). EXPLAIN YOUR CHOICES ALWAYS. For prints,
what kind of plastic and why?>
